# Contributing to OpenCaptive

We welcome contributions to the OpenCaptive project and appreciate your interest in improving the codebase. To ensure a smooth contribution process, please follow the steps below:

## Contribution Process

1. **Fork the Repository** 🍴  
   Start by creating a personal copy of the main repository on your GitHub account. This allows you to work on your own version of the project without affecting the original code.

2. **Create a New Feature Branch** 🌿  
   In your forked repository, create a separate branch specifically for your changes. This helps isolate your work and makes it easier to manage and review contributions. Use a descriptive name for your branch that reflects the feature or fix you're working on.

3. **Implement Your Changes** ✍️  
   Develop and test your feature or bug fix in your feature branch. Make sure your code follows the project's coding standards and best practices. Be sure to write tests to validate your changes and ensure that everything works as expected.

4. **Submit a Pull Request** 🔄  
   Once your changes are complete and fully tested, submit a pull request (PR) from your feature branch to the `main` branch of the main repository. Include a clear and concise description of the changes you made, why they are necessary, and any relevant context or documentation that might be helpful to reviewers.

5. **Code Review and Approval** 👩‍🏫  
   After submitting your pull request, the maintainers will review your code. They may request changes or ask for clarification. Engage in the review process and make any necessary updates. Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the `main` branch.
